Explanation of the Code Changes:
Adding OrigamiTicket Holders: The addOrigamiHolder function is responsible for adding addresses to the list of OrigamiTicket holders.

NFT Transfers: The transferNFTs function transfers the RED, GREEN, and BLUE NFTs to random wallet addresses from the list of OrigamiTicket holders. It uses the Random class to select a random holder and perform the transfer using _transferFrom.

Daily Scheduling: The scheduleDailyExecution function schedules the contract to wake up daily and execute the NFT transfers. It checks the last execution time to ensure that the contract only wakes up once per day.

Final Rewards Distribution: The distributeRewards function, scheduled for execution on December 24, 2024, distributes 1 MAS to the holders of the RED, GREEN, and BLUE NFTs.

Autonomous Execution: The contract is set up to autonomously perform these operations without external services by leveraging Massa's ASC capabilities for scheduled operations.

Serialization: Helper functions are included to serialize and deserialize the list of OrigamiTicket holders for storage.
